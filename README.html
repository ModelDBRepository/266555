<p>Theoretical investigation of the effect of divisive inhibition on entrainment
</p>
<p>This is the readme for the paper:
</p>
<p>Papasavvas CA, Trevelyan AJ, Kaiser M, Wang Y (2020) Divisive gain
modulation enables flexible and rapid entrainment in a neocortical
microcircuit model. J Neurophysiol 123:1133-1143
</p>
<p>This model was contributed by C Papasavvas.
</p>
<p>Use the script entrainmentDemo to manipulate the parameters (initial phase diff., amplitude, frequency, and divisiveness parameter) and run the simulation.
</p>
<p>The script calls the function solverODEreduc which collects all the parameters and runs the enrtainment scenario/simulation.
</p>
<p>The solverODEreduc function calls the modelFunqVarInput which describes the model.
</p>
<p>The freq_analys function is called after the simulation for the spectral analysis of the generated signal.
</p>
<p>The entrainmentDemo in its default state produces the following graphs:

</p>
<p>if the phase is changed to 0 in the entrainmentDemo.m file then a graph that corresponds to Fig3A is produced
