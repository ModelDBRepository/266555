<p>Theoretical investigation of the effect of divisive inhibition on entrainment
</p>
<p>This is the readme for the paper:
</p>
<p>Papasavvas CA, Trevelyan AJ, Kaiser M, Wang Y (2020) Divisive gain
modulation enables flexible and rapid entrainment in a neocortical
microcircuit model. J Neurophysiol 123:1133-1143
</p>
<p>This model was contributed by C Papasavvas.
</p>
<p>Use the script entrainmentDemo to manipulate the parameters (initial phase diff., amplitude, and frequency) and run the simulation.
</p>
<p>A parameter set is loaded from optimSets.mat and the function transformSet is used to transform a 5-parameter set to an 8-parameter set by filling in the known connection weight ratios.
</p>
<p>The script calls the function solverODEvarInput2 which collects all the parameters and runs the enrtainment scenario/simulation
</p>
<p>The ODE solver calls the modelFunqNELvarInputPhase which describes the model
</p>
<p>The freq_analysis2 function is called after the ODE solver to do spectral analysis on the generated signal
</p>
<p>The entrainmentDemo in its default state produces the following graphs:

</p>
<p>if the phase is changed to 0 in the entrainmentDemo.m file then a graph that corresponds to Fig3A is produced
